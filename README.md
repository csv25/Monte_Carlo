Monte Carlo Simulation for Retirement Planning

This study aims to construct an optimal stock portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation
(Geeks), a method that models the relationship between risk rates, daily returns, and
adjusted close prices (i.e., final stock prices). By simulating how the stock market
evolves over time, it offers valuable insights for developing effective retirement
planning strategies.
Our analysis focuses on evaluating trends, assess portfolio risks, balancing trade-offs
between computational cost of simulations and the accuracy of return estimates for
our chosen fund. The resulting statistics highlight the long-term performance for
QSTFX, particularly for young professionals at the start of their careers who aim to
optimize their investment in 401(k) accounts, Roth IRAs, and HSAs.
